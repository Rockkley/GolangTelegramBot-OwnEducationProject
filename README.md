# GolangTelegramBot OWN_STUDY_PROJECT
My first attempt to write a Telegram bot using Golang while studying Golang :}<br>
The bot will be getting updates as my Golang knowledge evolves..<br>
Functions of the current version:<br>
<ul><li>Sending "Welcome" message depending on the time of day ("Good morning, #NAME/Good day.../Good evening.../Good night...)
  and if the user is new to the bot or not. ("ðŸ¦† Now you are a new member of the club!/"ðŸ”‘Welcome back!")
<li>Writing users ID to the file "users.txt" and checks it on every update.</ul>
